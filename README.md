# Restyled Actions

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before using Restyled as a GitHub Action, make sure you prevent any previous
> hosted installation from running. Otherwise, they may fight over the restyled
> branch. This can be done by uninstalling the GitHub App entirely, or
> configuring it for specific repositories and excluding the one where you plan
> to use GitHub Actions.

## Usage Examples

The [`restyle` CLI][restyler] is meant to one thing and do it well: re-format
files according to configuration and commit any changes. The actions in this
repository are for installing the CLI, running it, and exposing its results such
that other, non-restyled actions can be used to do useful things. Below are
example workflows for doing such things.

[restyler]: https://github.com/restyled-io/restyler#readme

In all cases, we recommend creating the workflow as `restyled.yml`, naming it
`Restyled`, and using `concurrency` to cancel redundant jobs:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/restyled.yml

name: Restyled

concurrency:
  group: ${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}
  cancel-in-progress: true
```

### Status Check

## Workflow Permissions

The Restyled actions themselves require no permissions. However, `contents:read`
is required for `actions/checkout` and `pull-requests:write` is required for
`peter-evans/create-pull-request`, which are both used above.

Default permissions for workflows can be adjusted in your repository settings,
or a `permissions` key can be used in the workflow itself. For more details, see
the [documentation][permissions-docs].
